# basic-python

This is a Basic Python tutorial I made for a session for my juniors at college. I thought this might be helpful for others too. Feel free to clone, edit and share this.

Would appreciate edits and corrections.

[install jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html) to run these notebooks.

I've taken these tutorials and edited it depending on where I take my sessions.
